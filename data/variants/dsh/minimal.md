## bash

Run commands in a bash shell
* When invoking this tool, the contents of the "command" parameter does NOT need to be XML-escaped.
* You don't have access to the internet via this tool.
* You do have access to a mirror of common linux and python packages via apt and pip.
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user.
* To inspect a particular line range of a file, e.g. lines 10-25, try 'sed -n 10,25p /path/to/the/file'.
* Please avoid commands that may produce a very large amount of output.
* Please run long lived commands in the background, e.g. 'sleep 10 &' or start a server in the background.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "command": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The bash command to run. Relative path is preferred in the command."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "command"
  ]
}
```

## str_replace_editor

Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`
